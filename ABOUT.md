# About Keylogger Project

## Overview

The **Keylogger Project** is a simple Python-based application designed to log keyboard input events (key presses and releases). This tool records the keys pressed on the keyboard and saves them in both text and JSON formats. The project is developed using Python’s **Tkinter** library for the user interface and **pynput** library for detecting key events.

## Features

- **Key Logging**: Records both key presses and releases and stores them in `key_log.txt` and `key_log.json`.
- **Text and JSON Storage**: Captures logged keys in a readable format (text file) and a structured format (JSON).
- **Start/Stop Control**: Offers buttons to start and stop the keylogger.
- **Educational Use**: Designed to educate users on how keyloggers capture input data and store it for analysis.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: The programming language used to develop this keylogger.
- **Tkinter**: Python’s standard GUI library used to create the graphical user interface.
- **Pynput**: A Python library to monitor and control input devices such as the keyboard.
- **JSON**: For saving logged key events in a structured format.
- **Text File**: For saving logged keys in plain text.

## Purpose and Usage

This project was created for **educational purposes** only to demonstrate how keyloggers work. It serves as an example to understand how keyloggers can monitor keyboard inputs, capture key press and release events, and store this information for later analysis.

The **Keylogger Project** is **not** intended to be used for malicious activities. Users must obtain **explicit consent** from individuals before running this tool. Unauthorized use of keyloggers can be illegal and unethical.

## Limitations

- **Ethical Concerns**: This project is meant to educate and inform. Using it without permission on others' devices can be considered an invasion of privacy and may be illegal in some jurisdictions.
- **Local Use Only**: The project logs keys on the local machine and does not transmit the data remotely.

## License

The **Keylogger Project** is licensed under an **educational use license** and cannot be used for any commercial purposes. Please refer to the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for further details.

## Conclusion

By using this tool, you can gain insights into how keyloggers function and how they interact with the keyboard input system. Understanding such tools is essential for anyone interested in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, or digital forensics.
